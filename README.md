# YouMove

## Overview 

YOUMOVE is a workout planner app that allows users to plan out and make changes to their workouts. Each user has their own account by logging in through Google - once they have logged in, they are able to create workouts, as well as add exercises to those specific workouts. Users are able to edit or delete the exercises they add to their workouts, as well as delete entire workouts altogether. This application is mobile and desktop friendly!

## About This Project

This is my second project I completed at the General Assembly Software Engineering bootcamp. The purpose of the project was to practice newly learned concepts such as Node, Express, MongoDB and Mongoose, API's and CRUD, building on our first unit which focused on CSS, HTML and Javascript. 

This project was built and presented in one week. 

## Technologies Used

## Next Steps

- Create an Archive page for Users to move their workouts into a completed page and remove from the homepage 
- Organize workouts by date
- Edit CSS for mobile users to allow for more workouts to be added without the lower div overlapping.
- Edit CSS for mobile users to be able to see the notes section for each exercise. 
- Edit CSS for desktop users to allow more workouts to be added without the delete button glitching. 
- Clean up HTML and added partials for headers/footers.
